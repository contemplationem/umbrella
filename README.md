# umbrella

Hello, future Contemplationem!

This is my attempt to make it a little bit easier to recover when my hard drive fails, which it does at least every other day these days. Ideally, this will function as an umbrella carried during a cloudy day, deterring future failures. We'll see how well that works out. 

Hopefully the script works!
