# ensure SSH is installed
sudo apt install ssh

# enable root login over SSH
sudo sed -i "s/#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password/PermitRootLogin yes/" /etc/ssh/ssh_config
# for some reason, this command is not working. the rest of it is though. so I guess I just won't be able to get root access through SSH

# restart SSH
service ssh restart

# paste status of SSH
sudo systemctl status sshd
